An alright project plan, even though a bit vague here with unfinished or copied content. Below are some thoughts and pointers.

The introduction seems a bit like it's half-finished, though it tells that you have thought a bit about how you prioritize the project features.

Do remember that video playback shouldn't necessarily be a top requirement for a project. The project's main focus revolves around audio files. Unless you get video playback working easily, you should push the feature back a bit until you have all the audio related features ready and tested.

Iterations give some solid insight into how the project should progress. It's nice to notice that you have considered error checking and placeholders for graphics.

You've mostly just described what the libraries you used are for. Aside that, using all three of Qt, FFmpeg and SDL2 might be a bit much to chew. The latter two might offer the same functionalities.. as you might've described in the text, too.

The UML diagram is detailed - a nice addition.

Work distributions seems alright. Just remember that FFmpeg and Qt as a whole might need some additional help from other members.

As for testing, it's nice that you've considered memory leaks. If you do manual testing, remember to document it well!

The schedule has some arbitrary version numbers, which I don't understand..

We can further discuss on Slack and in the mid-meeting, in which we'll have a closer look on what you've got done. You'll get more information about the meeting shortly.
